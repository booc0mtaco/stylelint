A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.

## Features

-   parses **CSS-like syntaxes** like SCSS, Sass, Less and SugarSS
-   has over **170 built-in rules** to catch errors, apply limits and enforce stylistic conventions
-   supports **plugins** so you can create your own rules or make use of plugins written by the community
-   automatically **fixes** some violations (*experimental feature*)
-   is **well tested** with over 15000 unit tests
-   supports **shareable configs** that you can extend or create your own of
-   is **unopinionated** so you can tailor the linter to your exact needs
-   has a **growing community** and is used by [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/879890885467584/improving-css-quality-at-facebook-and-beyond/), [GitHub](https://github.com/primer/stylelint-config-primer) and [WordPress](https://github.com/ntwb/stylelint-config-wordpress/)
